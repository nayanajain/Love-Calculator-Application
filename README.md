# Love-Calculator-Application

This is a spring mvc project which uses the concept and insights of 
- formatters
- converters
- propertyBinders
- Validators
- Sessions
- Cookies
- ModelAttribute
- InitBinders and so on.
I have used java based configuration to configure the project. 
The project also sends the mail to the requested mailId. 
It is a fun- application which calculates whether the couple are in love or just friends.
